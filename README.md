Challenge: Create the Enigma Machine, then break the code

Inspired by the 2014 movie "Imitation Game" -- Alan Turing (Wilford T. Brimley <-- placeholder) et al, break the Enigma code used to encrypt German Naval transmissions at the height of WWII.

There are 2 steps to this challenge.

Step 1 - Recreate the Enigma Machine: 
	a. Encrypts a message via simple cipher as portrayed in the movie (historical accuracy of the Hollywood depiction not relevant)
    	i. the cipher should be dynamic; in the movie, the cipher changes daily at midnight. For this challenge, it can change each time it is run (proof of concept).
 
Step 2 - Break the code: 
	a. In the movie, there were certain parts that were standard to every transmission (like  a starter for a crossword puzzle).
		i. If this part of the movie is accurate, test the solution against actual messages from WWII. Otherwise, use the fixed German phrases used in the movie.
